# Identity Document Classification Application
This application features a simple React UI that allows users to submit test examples (Identity Document images) and receive the classified class via backend service built using FastAPI that makes inference using a simple CNN model. The services are wrapped into a Docker Compose configuration for deployment.

## Description
There are 3 services/containers: <br>
Model Container: Container that holds the machine learning models to deploy. <br>
Backend Service: Contains inference API built using FastAPI that receives the image from the UI and returns the prediction. <br>
Frontend: A React application that provides UI for uploading a test image and display the predicted class. <br>

## Getting Started
### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
